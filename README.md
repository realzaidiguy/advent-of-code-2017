## [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/)

Daily coding challenges for the month of December 2017

#### Description from the Advent of Code site:
Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.
